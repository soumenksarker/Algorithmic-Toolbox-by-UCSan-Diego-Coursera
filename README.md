#Python solutions 

In this course, I've learned to design Algorithm to solve problem base on problem nature and complexity constraints. Starting from naive and end with efficient solutions.

__Problem Solving using Algorithmic techniques(Runtime Analysis, Aymptotic notation, Greedy(Knapsack), divide and conquer(binary search, selection sort, merge sort and quick sort) with huge lists, dynamic programming(knapsack, max value of an arithmatic expression) [this](https://coursera.org/share/72161b3795b7ada102bde0d2872bc844) link__
