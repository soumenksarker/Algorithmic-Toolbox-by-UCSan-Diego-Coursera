In this course, I've learned to design Algorithm to solve problem base on problem nature and complexity constraints. Starting from naive and end with efficient solutions.

__Problem Solving using Algorithmic techniques(Runtime Analysis, Aymptotic notation, Greedy(Fractional/Unbounded Knapsack, Optimal money change, Optimal car_fueling), divide and conquer(binary search, selection sort, merge sort and quick sort) with huge lists, dynamic programming(edit distance, knapsack, max value of an arithmatic expression) [this](https://coursera.org/share/72161b3795b7ada102bde0d2872bc844) link__
